PyModulation is a Python library that implements a collection of digital modulation and demodulation techniques with a strong focus on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) applications. The library is designed to provide a simple, consistent, and extensible interface for working with different modulation schemes, enabling rapid development, testing, and prototyping of wireless communication systems.

The project is fully open source and is available in a `GitHub repository <https://github.com/mgm8/pymodulation>`_. All contributions are welcome! If you found a bug, developed a new feature, or want to improve the documentation, there are two ways to do so: open an issue describing the suggested modification, or by opening a pull request. More information are available in the `CONTRIBUTING file <https://github.com/mgm8/pymodulation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Any questions or suggestions can also be addressed to Gabriel Mariano Marcelino <`gabriel.mm8@gmail.com <mailto:gabriel.mm8@gmail.com>`_>.
